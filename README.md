# Tip Calculator

A simple calculator that calculates tip using user input.

## Description

Using JavaFX, I created a GUI featuring input fields for the amount and number a guest, and a slider to select the desired tip percentage. Once all of the fields are filled, the total cost, tip amount, and split cost is displayed.
